Hello.

My name is Alex Rogozhnikov (Алексей Михайлович Рогожников), and 'brilliantly wrong' is my personal blog.

<!--I'm working at [Yandex](http://yandex.ru), involved in [CERN](http://cern.ch) projects. -->
Area of my interest is development of Machine Learning methods (mostly, somehow applied to fundamental sciences, though not limited by those). 

I have PhD in mathematics and physics from [Moscow University](http://www.msu.ru/en/).

I have some other degrees as well :)

* master degree in Math &amp; CS from Computer Science faculty of MSU
* master degree from [faculty of mathematics](http://math.hse.ru) of Higher School of Economics (definitely great place if you want to devote your life to math) 
* degree from [Yandex School of Data Analysis](http://yandexdataschool.com), 
  which is one of the best places (or simply best place?) to study programming, data analysis and machine learning.
* I also have many [degrees of freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(mechanics)) (as many other complex physical systems :)     


If you're interested in things I am doing, take a look at

* [InfiniteBoost](https://github.com/arogozhnikov/infiniteboost) 
* [machine learning demonstrations](https://arogozhnikov.github.io/2016/04/28/demonstrations-for-ml-courses.html) 
* [gradient boosted reweighter](https://github.com/arogozhnikov/hep_ml/blob/master/notebooks/DemoReweighting.ipynb)
* [uniform gradient boosting](https://github.com/arogozhnikov/hep_ml/blob/master/notebooks/BoostingToUniformity.ipynb)
* [visualization of optimal control of oscillations](http://arogozhnikov.github.io/2015/12/19/optimal-control-of-oscillations.html) 

Sometimes I give courses of Machine Learning: 
Take a look at [MLHEP 2016 slides]({% post_url 2016-07-12-mlhep-2016-slides %}) and [repository](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/mlhep2016) 
or [course](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/MLatImperial2017) at Imperial College, London.

There is also quite complete course of 
[machine learning in science and industry]({% post_url 2017-04-20-machine-learning-in-science-and-industry %})
