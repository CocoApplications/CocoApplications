    <h3>
        About CocoData
    </h3>
    <p>
        CocoRead enables the user to view the pdf files on their file system in a table format, and then allows the user to open any PDF file in that table with the browser of their choice. In addition, the search bar can be used to filter the results.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        CocoRead can open Jupyter Notebooks and HTML files by specifying IPYNB or HTML, respectively. Please note, the Jupyter notebook's working directory must be set to a sub directory of the home directory. For example, the 'jupyter notebook' terminal command must be used in the following directory: '/Users/[username]/[folder-containing-jupyter-notebooks]/'). CocoRead also can open .py, .r, and .txt file in Jupyter notebook's edit mode when choosing the IPYNB option.
    </p>

    <p>
        With CocoRead, there is an option to choose between browsers, Chrome or Safari, and open links in an existing window or new window.
