<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><h3 style="text-align: left;">Why the blog was named so?&nbsp;</h3><div>It is the citation from Isaac Asimov:</div><blockquote>"Because we have a neurophysicist in our country who knows your work, and he thinks it is brilliant. You have rather jumped into the unknown, he says, and you may be wrong - but if you are, you are brilliantly wrong."</blockquote><div><br /><h3 style="text-align: left;">What is this blog about?</h3></div><div>Science. Primarily, fundamental physics and mathematics. Maybe some programing notes will be added too. There is a number of topics I am particularly interested in, and I'd be happy to discuss them:</div><div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Quantum Mechanics and everything connected</li><li>Control theory and optimization problems</li><li>Information theory / algorithmics</li><li>Numerical methods</li><li>Machine Learning</li><li>Integrable models (If you heard something about Ising model, probably you have some idea of this).</li></ul><div><br /></div></div></div>
