    <h3>
        About CocoLinks
    </h3>
    <p>CocoLinks's main feature makes it easy to open a set of links without opening a browser and navigating through a bookmark manager. </p>

    <p>CocoLinks has the option to choose between Chrome or Safari when deciding to open links into an existing window or in a new window. Notice the webpage count next to each set of links. </p>


    <h3>
        How is it Useful?
    </h3>
    <p>
        When opening, saving, or deleting links, CocoLinks operates on the front most window of the “checked” web browser. If you are looking for a website that is behind many application windows, try the Search button.
    </p>
    <p>
        Check out CocoReader, a free tool for managing pdfs the browser. Also, please see the paid app, CocoSpace, a combination of CocoLinks and CocoReader with a few extra features.
    </p>
