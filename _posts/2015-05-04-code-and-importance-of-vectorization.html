<p>That awkward moment, when the code written in matlab is easier to read and understand then tons of explanations: <br/>
	<a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/code/rbm.m">Salakhudinovâ€™s code of RBM</a>
</p>
<p> This code IMHO is a good argument when you need to explain someone that he/she &nbsp;<strong>really</strong>
    needs to&nbsp;learn at&nbsp;least one language or tool with vectorization, no&nbsp;matter whether it&nbsp;is&nbsp;R, matlab, or&nbsp;numpy or&nbsp;theano in&nbsp;python. 
</p>


<p> I also want to note, that vectorization is not a `silver bullet`.
    For example, you can see Friedman's highly optimized fortran
    <a href="https://github.com/dwf/glmnet-python/blob/master/glmnet/glmnet.f">code of GLM</a>
    (Generalized linear models)

    Disclaimer: you'll be unable to unsee this.
