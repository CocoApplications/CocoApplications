# Lean Manufacturing
Lean Manufacturing is the project management system of reducing waste, managing labor efficiency, and providing a framework to solve problems. Lean manufacturing is one system under the Lean "umbrella" of project management. There are many practical applications with various Lean systems.

The core is Lean Manufacturing's philosophy. Around the core, the Lean system is made up of People, Processes, and Technology. On the outer core, Lean tools are employed to parts of the Lean system.

### Lean Industries
The concept of Lean began within the automotive and aerospace manufactoring sectors in the early 1990s. Since then, Lean has spread to various manufacturing industries. Some industries that use Lean include the following: automotive, machine tool, semi-process, electronics manufacturing, steel, pump, furnishing, and oil. However, various sectors have not caught on to Lean concepts due to lack of awareness, anxiety of change, and training. 

### Lean Philosophy

This list describes some essential tools of Lean manufacturing:

1.  "Self Organization"  
2.  "Kaizen or Cont. Improvement"
3.  "Quality Assurance"
4.  "Standardized work"
5.  "Mudha or Waste Elimination"
6.  "Just-In-Time"

There are many more tools. The first tool in the list, "Self Organization," is necessary for successful Lean implementation. For example, Lean Manufacturing can be compared to Worker Participation Groups (WPC), which was the starting point of Lean.

Worker Participation Groups expanded into training programs in the 1990s. There were joint activities between various participation groups, but these groups were eventually centralized. Employee leaders had increased responsibility with joint activities. These leaders had two different jobs, and were isolated in their respective departments. People who had hope for new initiatives were snubbed out by those interested in only "making the numbers." 

The first step in Lean Manufacturing is to keep "lean management" separate from regular operations. A separate organization dedicated to Lean systems would result in fewer conflicting priorities. A lean manager assigned to a facility would have a "sensei", teacher role. The manager would teach a council of leaders in the facility to steer lean projects.

### Lean Process

As in the Philosophy, there are steps to achieve the Lean Process. The process can be best described as the equipment used to create a product with pre-determined requirements. The tools involved in the Process are "Kaizen or Continuous Improvement" and "Mudha or Waste Elimination." Instead of implying that workers should be continuously improving and eliminating waste, the Lean Process accomplishes this with its successful implementation.

##### Eliminating Waste and 3 M's: Man, Material, and Machine.

As shown in the table above, improvements to the manufacturing process can minimize cost and maximize profit. Compared to a mass production system, Lean Manufacuturing aims to utilize less raw materials, create the same products, and increase variety.

Here are some examples of waste from (Alukal, George. "Create a Lean, Mean Machine."):

1. Poor layout. 
2. Long setup time. 
3. Poor workplace organization. 
4. Poor equipment maintenance. 
5. Inadequate training.
6. Use of improper methods. 
7. Statistically incapable processes. 
8. Not following procedures. 
9. Instructions or information unclear.
10. Poor planning.
11. Supplier quality problems.
12. Inaccurate gages. 
13. Poor work environment (for example, light, heat, humidity, cleanliness and clutter).

In addition to eliminating waste, value can be added to a product. This improvement can be any process that is perceived, by the consumer, to add value. 

### Lean People and Partners
Lean is not a top-down endeavor. Every layer of an organization and every level of employee is involved in Lean. (Manoway, Dina. "Rallying Behind Lean.") points out, “Who better to spot inefficiencies that fail to provide customer value than the people who perform the tasks?” This rhetoric question leads to an observation: Lean organizations inform employees of stakes and lean initiatives; employees contribute more to the organization and feel good about their contribution.

Ideally, Lean work organizations are decentralized and multidisciplinary. Lean leaders should have good communication and team management skills because they are responsible for driving effective change in their departments. These leaders can become Lean certified from credible organizations such as AME, SME, and ASQ.  

Lean systems that use "Just-In-Time," a combination of many Lean tools, have better customer-supplier relationships. "Just-In-Time" allows production based on consumer demand instead of what is needed to complete a project. This means that customers get the product faster, and company completes the project on schedule.

### Problem Solving

Lean's "Standardized Work" tool is documentation procedure that makes flexible, higher quality documents. The adoption of a single problem-solving tool is the first step of standardization. In addition, a Lean organizations' reporting should be consistent across every manufacturing unit. This approach allows for better problem solving across all facilities, project replication, and "apples to apples" outcome measurement.

Projects are stored in a repository, a shared online document. This enables sites, in an organization, to share lessons learned and knowledge with each other. The repository diminishes repeat mistakes, and creates a positive competition between sites. The next step is to benchmark methods and accomplishments against recognized leaders in Lean.  Benchmarking can also be used to show customers the lean program in action.
