<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I always thought of Jacques Cousteau as film director, maybe scientist or biologist.<div><br /></div><div>Today I've read in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Cousteau" target="_blank">wiki</a>, that he was academician, the co-inventor of aqua-lung, he worked over first waterproof film cameras.</div><div><br /></div><div>Sounds logical, but I didn't expect this.</div><div><br /></div><div>Moreover, he was the man who worked over (and experimented with) ships with sails working on Magnus effect. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbosail" target="_blank">turbosail</a> technology was co-invented by him, but there is only one ship using it &mdash; the Alcyone, one Cousteau was engineering with his team.&nbsp;</div></div>
