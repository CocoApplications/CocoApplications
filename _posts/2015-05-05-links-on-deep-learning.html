<p>Didn't know where to put it, so just for the memory will post it to blog. </p> <ul><li><a href='https://charlesmartin14.wordpress.com/2015/03/25/why-does-deep-learning-work/'>https://charlesmartin14.wordpress.com/2015/03/25/why-does-deep-learning-work/</a> <br />There is much fuzz nowadays about why deep learning works at all (there is no any deep theory under today), and I love reading these hypothetical explanations (though I'm absolutely sure all of them are wrong. A good explanation of success should give you new ideas about what new things will work). <br> <br>In this couple of articles author is arguing that the action of RBM can be derived as an action of renormalization group.  BTW, this is not a first physical analogy in neural network. Apart from RBMs which use Gibbs-like distribution, there were explanations of Hopfiled neural networks via spin glasses and derivation of update rule from mean-field theory.  <br /><br /></li><li><a href='http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-NLP-RNNs-Representations/'>http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-NLP-RNNs-Representations/</a> <br />This impressive post was written a year ago and shows recent fresh ideas about deep representations of objects. Namely, I was surprised with how common space of representation for different objects may help in translations. <br /><br /></li><li><a href='http://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/icml09-ConvolutionalDeepBeliefNetworks.pdf'>http://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/icml09-ConvolutionalDeepBeliefNetworks.pdf</a><br /> Finally, a link to a paper where convolutional RBMs were introduced. Using softmax to combine with poll-layer is a good idea.   </li></ul> <p>PS. Found a link of recommended reading for new LISA-lab students.   <a href='http://www.datakit.cn/blog/2014/09/22/Reading_lists_for_new_LISA_students.html'>http://www.datakit.cn/blog/2014/09/22/Reading_lists_for_new_LISA_students.html </a>  </p>
