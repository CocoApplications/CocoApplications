<p>
    When one designs library/API/whatever, there are two things that one always cares of: flexibility and minimalism.
    Good solutions incorporate both these points, but sometimes one has to sacrifice 'a very useful feature' for the sake of simplicity of system.

<p>
	Ok, this was just to say: I'm disappointed by PEP-3113 introduced in python 3<br/>
	<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3113/">https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3113/</a><br/>
	<br/>
	It's already implemented in python3 and it removes tuple unpacking in function arguments.<br/>
	Yes, this cool feature is not available in python 3:<br/>
	<br/>
	<code>map( lambda id, (key, group): (len(group), key), data) </code><br/>
	<br/>
	Problems with annotations are understandable, but there is category of applications when automatic untupling is very handy and annotations are not needed.
